# Custom configuration entries, settable via "device configuration"
# Below is a custom firmware configuration example.
# Uncomment and modify according to your needs:

config_schema:
  - ["mqtt.enable", true]
  - ["pins", "o", {title: "Pins layout"}]
  - ["pins.led", "i", 13, {title: "LED GPIO pin"}]
  - ["pins.button", "i", 0, {title: "Button GPIO pin"}]
  - ["pins.relay", "i", 12, {title: "Relay GPIO pin"}]
  - ["debug.factory_reset_gpio", 0]

# These settings get compiled into the C structure, and can be accessed
# from the C code this way:
#
# Also, in this config_schema section, you can override existing
# settings that has been created by other libraries. For example, debug log
# level is 2 by default. For this firmware we can override it to 3:
#
# config_schema:
#  - ["debug.level", 3]
